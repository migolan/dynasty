# dynasty

Dynasty extracts the class hierachy for your Python package, to track down lost or misplaced classes and help prevent [ravioli code](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure).

See the [example jupyter notebook](https://github.com/migolan/dynasty/blob/main/example.ipynb) for demonstration.
